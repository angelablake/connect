## Theme Switcher â€“ Make it yours

The `core.css` file simply holds the minimum layout styles and generally speaking doesn't need to change. 

The theme stylesheets are loaded dynamically via javascript. To set your default theme, simply define it in the `config.json` file; e.g. `"theme": "kubrik"` 

The "Theme Switcher" allows you to preview any theme via a query parameter in your url. Just append `?theme=bulky` to your url to see whichever theme you want. 

* **Switching themes** â€“ Themes can be previewed dynamically based on a URL query parameter. To preview or share your site with a different theme, just add `?theme=bulky`, `?theme=kubrik`, `?theme=bright`, `?theme=dark`, or `?theme=minimal` to your URL, for example:
  
  `https://<username>.github.io/?theme=bulky`
  
  If no `theme` parameter is present, or if the value is invalid, the **minimal** theme will be loaded by default.
  
  To add a new theme, simply create a new CSS file in the `styles/` folder and add its name to the theme list in `main.js`.

* **Stylesheet tweaks** â€“ Edit your theme file in the `styles/` folder for colors and effects, or edit `core.css` for layout tweaks.  
* **HTML changes** â€“ everything lives in `index.html`. Keep it minimal or go wild.  
* **Custom domain** â€“ add a `CNAME` file with your domain name to use your own URL.
