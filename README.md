## Make it yours

* **Choose a theme** â€“ set `"theme": "modern"` or `"theme": "minimal"` in your config.  
* **Create your own theme** â€“ add a new CSS file in the `styles` directory and reference it in your config.  
* **Stylesheet tweaks** â€“ crack open any theme's CSS and add your brand flare.  
* **HTML changes** â€“ everything lives in `index.html`. Keep it minimal or go wild.  
* **Custom domain** â€“ add a `CNAME` file with your domain name to use your own URL.
